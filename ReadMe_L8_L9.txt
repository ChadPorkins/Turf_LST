This is a script in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) code editor, which processes Landsat 9 satellite imagery to obtain Land Surface Temperature (LST) data for a region of interest (ROI) defined by the variable NEMIA.

Here's what the code does:

The script starts by adding the ROI (NEMIA) to the GEE map and centering the map on the ROI.

The script then loads Landsat 9 imagery using the ee.ImageCollection() function and applies a filter to only include images that intersect with the ROI defined by NEMIA. It also filters the images based on their acquisition date, retaining only the images acquired between August 1, 2022, and August 31, 2023.

Next, the script defines a function named masking to mask clouds and shadows in the Landsat imagery. This function takes an image as input, extracts the Quality Assessment (QA) band, and creates a mask by bitwise operations on the cloud, shadow, and cirrus bits in the QA band. The function returns an updated image with the clouds and shadows masked out.

The script then applies the masking function to the Landsat image collection using the map() function, sorts the resulting images by cloud cover, and calculates the mean of the cloud-free images. This creates a single Landsat image with minimal cloud cover over the ROI.

The script clips the cloud-free image to the ROI (NEMIA) using the clip() function.

The script defines a function named scale to scale the Landsat image bands to their physical units. This function multiplies the reflectance values of the optical bands by 0.0000275 and subtracts 0.2 from them. It also multiplies the brightness temperature values of the thermal bands by 0.00341802 and adds 149.0 to them. The function returns the scaled image with additional bands.

The script applies the scale function to the clipped image to obtain a scaled image.

The script adds the scaled image to the map with default visualization parameters and also adds a layer with a true color composite of the Landsat image.

The script selects the thermal band of the scaled image and converts the brightness temperature values from Kelvin to Celsius.

Finally, the script adds the LST layer to the map with a custom color palette and exports the LST image to Google Drive using the Export.image.toDrive() function. The exported image will be named "L9_Summer_22_August" and saved to a folder with the same name. The exported image will be clipped to the bounds of the ROI defined by NEMIA and have a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The maximum number of pixels allowed in the exported image is set to 1e13.
